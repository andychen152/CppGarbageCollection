# C++ Garbage Collection
Andy Chen, Andrew Huang

## Project Vision: ##
C++ does not have an internal garbage collector; however, many programmers have taken the initiative to implement one. Most of these are basic garbage collectors that is prone to errors and does not scale. Our goal is to implemented researched techniques improving the functionality and speed of the basic garbage collectors. We will do this by starting with a baseline garbage collector and continually testing and improving the code. 

## Outline Schedule for Project Execution (Tentative): ##

Week 4/21 - 4/27
* Write customized tests to test accuracy of baseline system and understand where it fails
* Test speed using Garbage Collection Benchmark
  * http://www.hboehm.info/gc/gc_bench.html 

Week 4/28 - 5/4
* Identify cases where our garbage collector fails and implement fix
